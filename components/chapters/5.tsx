          Gold comes gladly and in increasing quantities to anyone who saves at
          least 10% of their earnings.
        </li>
        <li>Gold works diligently for those who invest it wisely.</li>
        <li>
          Gold stays close to those who invest it cautiously and with the
          guidance of the wise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gold runs away from those who invest in businesses and purposes they
          do not understand.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gold runs away from those who chase high-risk/high-reward investments.
        </li>
